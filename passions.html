                <p>A weird dude with a chipped tooth, messy hair and Red shirt is singing</p>

                <p>There once was a ship that put to sea
                The name of the ship was the Billy O' Tea
                The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
                Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)</p>

                <p>Soon may the Wellerman come
                To bring us sugar and tea and rum
                One day, when the tonguing is done
                We'll take our leave and go</p>

                <p>She'd not been two weeks from shore
                When down on her a right whale bore
                The captain called all hands and swore
                He'd take that whale in tow (huh)</p>

                <p>Soon may the Wellerman come
                To bring us sugar and tea and rum
                One day, when the tonguing is done
                We'll take our leave and go</p>

                <p>Da-da-da-da-da
                Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
                Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da</p>

                <p>Before the boat had hit the water
                The whale's tail came up and caught her
                All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
                When she dived down low (huh)</p>

                <p>Soon may the Wellerman come
                To bring us sugar and tea and rum
                One day, when the tonguing is done
                We'll take our leave and go</p>

                <p>No line was cut, no whale was freed
                The captain's mind was not of greed
                And he belonged to the Whaleman's creed
                She took that ship in tow (huh)</p>

                <p> Soon may the Wellerman come
                To bring us sugar and tea and rum
                One day, when the tonguing is done
                We'll take our leave and go</p>

                <p> Da-da-da-da-da
                Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
                Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da</p>

                <p>For forty days or even more
                The line went slack then tight once more
                All boats were lost, there were only four
                But still that whale did go (huh)</p>

                <p>Soon may the Wellerman come
                To bring us sugar and tea and rum
                One day, when the tonguing is done
                We'll take our leave and go</p>

                <p>As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
                The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
                The Wellerman makes his regular call
                To encourage the captain, crew and all (huh)</p>

                <p> Soon may the Wellerman come
                To bring us sugar and tea and rum
                One day, when the tonguing is done
                We'll take our leave and go</p>

                <p>Soon may the Wellerman come
                To bring us sugar and tea and rum
                One day, when the tonguing is done
                We'll take our leave and go</p>
